# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

In this project, we use 3 supervised machine learning models to predict breast cancer diagnosis in patients using cell data. The dataset used in this is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data. 

1. Random Forest
2. Logistic Regression
3. MARS

We then evaluate the accuracy and recall of all 3 algorithms to determine which machine learning method is the best given the context of the problem
